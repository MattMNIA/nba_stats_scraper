# NBA Stats Scraper

## Overview
The NBA Stats Scraper is a Python-based tool designed to extract player statistics from a basketball statistics website. It collects data for multiple seasons and organizes it into a structured format for further analysis.

## Features
- Scrapes player statistics for all seasons.
- Extracts data from HTML tables and aligns it with predefined headers.
- Saves the data into CSV files for easy access and analysis.

## Website
This scraper is designed to work with the basketball statistics website [NBA Stuffer](https://www.nbastuffer.com/2025-2026-nba-player-stats/). Ensure that the website allows scraping and complies with its terms of service.

## Limitations
- Data generated by CSS pseudo-elements (e.g., `::after`) cannot be retrieved using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`. These elements are rendered by the browser and require tools like Selenium to access.

## File Structure
- `main.py`: Entry point for the scraper.
- `scrape_season.py`: Handles scraping for individual seasons.
- `season_links.py`: Extracts links for all seasons.
- `table_parser/`: Contains utilities for parsing table headers and rows.
- `data/`: Stores the scraped CSV files.

## Usage
1. Install the required dependencies.
2. Run `main.py` to start the scraper.
3. The scraped data will be saved in the `data/` directory.
